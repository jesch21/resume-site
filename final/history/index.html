            <h2>Whole Lot of History!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                For a town as small as Lyncourt, there's a whole lot of local history to learn about! Lyncourt as a town began to see some real 
                growth in the early 1900s, particularly with the creation of Lyncourt School in 1908. This town quickly became a hub for activity
                in Onondaga County, benefiting from Court Street's easy access to Syracuse City.<br><br>
                
                From there, Lyncourt saw it's next major boost in 1922 with the opening of a large and modern factory by the 
                <strong>Syracuse China Company</strong>. This factory brought a lot of business to Lyncourt, even being used to manufacture 
                ceramic anti-tank mines during World War 2. Increased delivery traffic caused Lyncourt to replace the shoulders of Court Street
                 with a second lane, turning Lyncourt's portion of Court Street into a 4-lane road. This factory continued to bring business and 
                economic traffic to Lyncourt until 2009, when it officially closed. The factory instead ended up selling it's land to be used 
                temporarily by Lyncourt School for baseball fields, and the factory itself is still abandoned (it's become a fun place to explore).<br><br>

                Lyncourt, as a part of the larger region of Syracuse, also focuses a lot on some local Syracuse history. For example, Syracuse is home 
                to the <strong>Erie Canal Musesum</strong>, showing a portion of the once-operational Erie Canal that has been preserved along with a replica ship that 
                would sail over it. Additionally, Syracuse has an abnormally large amount of salt reserves, as it's believed to have used to be 
                a saltwater lake. This has caused salt to become quite important to Syracuse's history, reflected by our <strong>Salt Museum</strong> at Onondaga Lake 
                Park (shown in the picture below), and by our most iconic dish: Salt Potatoes, essentially Yucan Gold potatoes boiled in very salty water.
