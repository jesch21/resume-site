            <h2>Welcome to Lyncourt!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                New York is an intriguing state full of a great variety of locations to see and visit all throughout. From
                the well-known cities of New York Rochester or Albany, to the cinematic landscapes of the Adirondacks, so 
                much natural and man-made variety exists in the bounds of this state alone. And amidst this variety is the
                city of Syracuse: a city full of history and culture in it of itself. Situated right outside this city is a
                town so small it still uses Syracuse as it's city-location in it's address: Lyncourt.<br><br>

                I've chosen Lyncourt for this site because of how truly special it is to me. I was born in Lyncourt, and
                I've lived there all my life outside of the time I've spent at RIT. It's a very small town, but after spending
                all my life there I've come to find there's lots about it that adds charm and intrigue. It's my hope that this
                site will help to paint the picture that is Lyncourt in your head: <strong>a picture of snow and salt</strong>.
