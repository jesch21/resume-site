            <h2>High School Options!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                Although Lyncourt itself doesn't have any high schools, graduates of Lyncourt School by default can choose between two different 
                high schools that are nearby. Both are good options, and although I may be bias, I do believe one is a more ideal choice over the 
                other. The first option is <strong>Solvay</strong>. This school is strangely not very close to Lyncourt (about a 25 minute drive), 
                but for most of Lyncourt's time it's been the only choice of high school for Lyncourt Graduates. They supplied all of our busses, 
                and our track and football players would always play for Solvay's Middle School team. However, Solvay is in my opinion a slighlty 
                lower quality pick for a high school, as a significantly smaller amount of funding often causes it to have outdated technology and
                underfunded sports and arts programs.<br><br>

                The other option that wasn't always an option is <strong>East Syracuse Minoa Central High School</strong>, or ESM for short. Despite 
                it not being a general option, I was bound to go to ESM regardless as my dad is a teacher and coach there, which would have allowed me 
                to go. However, luckily for my friends and I, my graduating 8th Grade class was the first class of Lyncourt that could chose to go to
                ESM instead of Solvay. The fact that ESM wasn't the choice before is quite interesting, as Lyncourt is essentially directly up against 
                the border of the region where students go to ESM, and ESM is roughly half the distance from Lyncourt as Solvay is. Now, Lyncourt has 
                begun exclusively using ESM busses, and students can choose to join ESM's middle school sports programs as well. ESM is a great school 
                with a plethora of education opportunities, a very large and well-supported sports program, and many options for more advanced students 
                to take accelerrated classes. However I once again recognize that I'm likely bias in my description, as I'm an ESM graduate, so I 
                recommend you look closer at both yourself, and see which choice works best for you!
