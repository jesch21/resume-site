            <h2>What's Fun in Lyncourt!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                Lyncourt has a lot of fun memories for me, as I've spent all my childhood here. However, if there's any one thing that I believe
                Lyncourt is lacking is entertainment opportunities. Unfortunately there aren't too many things one can do for fun around here 
                outside of hanging out with friends or playing games online. However, there are a few spots that are worthy of a mention, and with 
                enough creativity you can have a whole lot of fun.<br><br>

                Lyncourt itself may not have a movie theater, but it is fortunate enough to be positioned very close to two very good theaters:
                <strong>Hollywood Theater and Regal Destiny USA</strong>. Hollywood Theater is a smaller theater in Mattydale, not far from 
                Lyncourt. This theater only has one theater room, and as such doesn't play as many movies. It's often playing older films, except 
                for the occasional new Marvel movie. However, tickets are often very cheap, so it's a good place to have fun on a budget. Alternatively, 
                the Regal Theater in Destiny USA is a more averaged-price but higher-quality experience. Although it's a slightly farther drive, 
                there are a much larger number of theater rooms, and this Regal often plays older movies for special events. It also offers RPX, 4D, 
                and other special movie experiences<br><br>

                Not a movie guy? Well how about a pool! Sehr park, a public park a few blocks from Court Street, has a small playground, a
                basketball court, and a public pool open during the summer. They also offer swimming lessons over the summer, and I've had fun 
                as a kid playing chess tournaments and doing arts & crafts at the park as well. Although the opening for the pool has decreased 
                with the waning number of available lifeguards, it's still a fun place to cool down on a hot summer's day.
