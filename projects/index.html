                    <h3>The Benefits of IPsec Tunneling</h3>
                    <p>
                        When: 2025<br><br>
                            
                        In my 6th semester at RIT, I took an Advanced Routing and Switching class. Our primary assignment was a group research project where we 
                        had to choose a routing and switching topic to research and test in a lab, collecting metrics to support our research. I worked with Ian Wu 
                        and Jamin Chen, and we chose to test the benefits of IPsec tunneling by simulating a tunnel in a lab environment and testing it's resilience 
                        against some simple security threats. The primary deliverable of this project was a final research paper.

                        Since 2023, my friends and I continued a tradition of watching a movie together on a Discord call, a tradition first put together during
                        quarantine to provide a new way to hang out that wasn't in person. At the time we managed the movie scheduled on a google sheet, but in 2024 
                        I decided to create a website in my spare time for our movie nights. I titled it The Corona Cinema after the name of our covid-era discord call 
                        channel, and have since continued adding to and improving it's features and functionality. I even went so far as to purchase it's domain.

                        In my 5th semester at RIT, I took a Web & Mobile 2 class. One of our final assignments was an individual project where we had to choose a location we
                        either visited or lived in for a time, then create a travel website for it to display our understanding of the various topics we covered in class. I 
                        chose to cover Lyncourt, the town I'm from.

                        In my second semester at RIT, I took a Cyber Security Policy and Law class. One of our final assignments was a blog post displaying our research
                        about a cyber policy-related issue. I chose to write about policiese regarding recordings or images taken from modern doorbells, like Ring doorbells.

                        When: 2021<br><br>
                            
                        For my English Capstone project in my Junior year of high school at ESM, I chose to research cybersecurity education in lower grade levels.
                        My research culminated in an informational website, which aimed to convey the importance of learning cybersecurity and the neccesity of greater
                        education on this topic for lower grade levels. This was my first exposure to cybersecurity.<br><br>
