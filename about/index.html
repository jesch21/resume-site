                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm <strong>Johnathan Eschbacher</strong>, a Computer Information Technology (CIT) major at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I have a deep interest
                    in Systems Administration and computer troubleshooting. Whether I'm creating a virtual machine for a failing legacy PC, creating a Microsoft Intune environment
                    to replace an older Active Directory setup, or managing a variety of IT tickets for various users, I'm always seeking to understand the systems I work with.
                    For my major, I'm completeing a concentration in Networking & Communications, as well as Cybersecurity, to round off my experience.
                </p>

                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    I appreciate learning new things and new ways to solve problems or complete tasks. I love getting my hands
                    on new technology, and will always be interested in pioneering new upgrades. Whether I'm troubleshooting
                    technical problems or building a Virtual Machine from scratch, I approach every task with a mindset focused
                    on long-term maintainability and efficiency. I also prefer to simplify complex tasks to make systems work 
                    reliably for myself and others who use them.
                </p>

                <h3>Education & Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I currently hold an Associates Degree of Math/Science from Onondaga Community College through East Syracuse Minoa's 
                    Spartan Academy Dual Enrollment Program, which I acquired in June of 2022, graduating high honor roll with a 3.917 GPA. 
                    I am currently working on a Bachelor of Computer Information Technology, with concentrations on Networking & Communications 
                    and Cybersecurity and an immersion in German Language, at Rochester Institute of Technology. I expect to graduate in December of 2025.
                </p>

                <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on somebody's computer, I have a million other things I enjoy doing on my own. Outside of playing games with friends, I 
                    enjoy recording gameplay and editing it into higher-production videos for YouTube. I've also been able to construct my own gaming PC, which I 
                    maintain along with the rest of my setup. I also enjoy any excuse to unbox new technology.
                </p>
