            <h2>Try Some Local Food!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                Lyncourt is nothing if not absolutely full of good food, and living on Court Street I was able to walk to almost
                all of these places from my house in no time at all. A personal favorite of mine is <strong>Pizza Cutters:</strong>
                a local pizza place that's been my go-to for pizza ever since it opened in 2017. It's original spot was a small shop
                with little-to-no seating and limited space for a menu, but they managed to move to a different spot along Court
                Street that added a restaraunt-sized array of seats and tables (inside and out), a wider variety of pizza items, and
                even an ice cream menu. If you're a fan of pizza, this place is a must.<br><br>

                If you're looking for something different, <strong>Ponchito's Taqueria</strong> is a great pick! Ponchitos is a 
                casual Mexican restaraunt with plentiful portions and delicious, fresh ingredients. They also manage to make food 
                at an incredibly quick pace with no drop in quality. I've gone there countless times as long as I can remember being
                in Lyncourt, and I've never had a bad experience there.<br><br>

                Looking for variety, but want it quick and easy? Well you're in luck, because Lyncourt has the perfect place to serve
                up deli-style foods from various cultures: <strong>Lucky 7's</strong>. While Lucky 7's is a convienence store, it's
                far more than that once you walk in. You can order a wide variety of foods, from BBQ Pulled Pork sandwiches and Roast
                Beef Platters, to Chicken Riggies and Fried Rice, they'll cook up a plethora of foods in no time at all. They're also
                situated on a hotspot of traffic, right on the intersection of Court Street and Tealle Ave, and it's absolutely boomed
                from it's popularity. <br><br>

                Want a sweat treat, or some freshly baked bread? Lyncourt is home to the award-winning <strong>Lyncourt Bakery!</strong>
                They serve a wide variety of baked goods, including 6-inch chocolate chip cookies for only $1! They also make pastries,
                pies, and seasonal apple fritters. They're fresh bread is cheap, and can come in full or sliced loafs, or as dinner rolls.
                If you're still not convinced, you'll need to try their Half-Moon Cookies, which were named the best half-moon cookies in
                Central New York in 2018!<br><br>

                Finally, it's important to recognize the local food places that were lost to time. One of my personal favorites that sadly
                went out of business was <strong>al Dente's Pizza</strong>. It's not the cheapest place, but they served up pasta and pizza
                with massive portions. Their chicken alfredo was incredible, and their pizza had the perfect sauce and cheese ratio. Sadly, 
                the location wasn't ideal and over time, the quality began to decrease as the customers did too, and they are no longer in
                business.<br><br> 
                
                Another sad series of events for Lyncourt history can be seen at the current Pizza Cutters location. This location is one I've
                jokingly considered to be cursed, as over the years many different food places have come and gone, all going out of business here 
                in little time. Before Pizza Cutters was a wide variety of places, from <strong>Bob Barker's Famous Hot Dogs</strong>, serving
                fast-food-like hot dogs and burgers, to New Court Deli & Grill, an older Deli location from before my time there. Right before
                Pizza Cutters came to that spot, there was a coffee shop there (whose name I've sadly forgotten), that sadly went out of business
                due to better competitors nearby.<br><br>

                Overall, the local food scene at Lyncourt is full of options, and as a resident foodie myself I highly encourage going through the
                full tour!
