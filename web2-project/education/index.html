            <h2>Learning in Lyncourt!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                <i>Editor's Note: As of writing this (in October of 2024) I've learned that starting this school year, Lyncourt students will no longer 
                    be given the choice of attending Solvay, and Lyncourt will not use any of Solvay's resources in sports or transportation. Despite this,
                    I still find it important to highlight the existence of this option, as it was present the entireity of my time in Lyncourt School.<br><br>
                </i>
                If you find yourself considering a longer stay in Lyncourt, you should know that Lyncourt has an incredible system for education. 
                The primary education source here is <strong>Lyncourt School</strong>: a PreK-8 school that's very small compared to most. 
                Although the class sizes have been steadily increasing, as Lyncourt has become a popular spot for many families immigrating into 
                the US, when I was there my graduating 8th grade class had 41 students (almost double the size of my 6th grade class). However, 
                the size of school ends up being a positive element for students, as you form closer bonds to your teachers. Additionally, the 
                teachers at Lyncourt are incredibly talented, and I've learned from first-hand experience that Lyncourt graduates found themselves 
                ahead in many topics as they entered High School largely from the better learning experience.<br><br>

                If you are or plan to be religous, Lyncourt has two very nice churches along Court Street that both offer a well-run religous education 
                program. The largest of the two, and the one I've had experience with, is the school in <strong>St. Daniel's Church</strong>. This 
                school follows a well-planned cirriculum and is staffed with a group of kind and understanding staff, with the higher-ups in the Church 
                being very involved in helping with the lessons.
