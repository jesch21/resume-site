            <h2>All About Lyncourt</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                Lyncourt is a small suburban community nestled in the north of Syracuse, right on the border of
                East Syracuse. It is a town of convenience, with so much of what you would ever need in walking, or short driving,
                distance from your home. Everything here is centered around Court Street: a 4-lane road that's heavy in traffic, but
                also attracts a great deal of business along it as it stretches on.<br><br>

                As a resident of Lyncourt, I've found many things in the town that make it a great place to live. Over the years the
                local food scene has grown exponentially, with a variety of places opening around Court Street. Lyncourt also finds
                itself in another part of Wegmans territory, meaning there's plenty of access to good shopping. Lyncourt is also home
                to great educaiton opportunities, from PreK-8 offered through Lyncourt School, and two high school options through Solvay
                or East Syracuse Minoa. As for entertainment, although I believe the local entertainment is slightly lacking, there are a
                few good options for placing to hang out in the nearby area, and good movie theaters in driving distance. Finally, this town
                is full of some interesting history, and even has some interesting tales of changes to the local businesses that I've experienced
                as I grew up. Overall, there's lots to do and lots to see in Lyncourt. <br><br>
