            <h2>Where to Hang!</h2>
            <p class="body-p">
                Although Lyncourt does have a good deal of entertainment options, as seen in the entertainment page, these options are often 
                very limiting. As such, there's many times I've wanted to hang-out with friends that we simply had to hang out in the ideal 
                spot and just do <i>something</i>. As such, I've collected a few good spots to hang out that we've used over the years.<br><br>

                Ironically, the best and most often-used hang-out spots from my friends and I is... <strong>the sidewalk</strong>. So many memories
                and good times have been made by simply walking around the streets of Lyncourt. Whether you're walking to someone's house, or 
                to Speedway, or just to nowhere, it's always a good time!<br><br>

                Looking for something more specific? Well, there are definetly good spots to spend your time. For example, <strong>behind the Speedway</strong> 
                (shown in the top image) is a good spot to chill. There's a well-positioned block of cement right behind it that's relatively 
                secluded and right outside Speedway, so you get a good place to eat your food after you get it.<br><br>

                In the end of the day, the best thing to do is to find things to do rather than places to do it. As shown in the picture below, we've 
                had to get creative over the years to find things that were fun to do. In this case, we quite literally just decided to all go in 
                on buying 120 McNuggets at 11pm, and it not only made an iconic photo, but an iconic memory as well. Once you learn what Lyncourt 
                has to offer, you'll have to trouble at all finding fun things to do!
